        make such modifications as are technically necessary to
        exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights

          <strong>
           4. Restrictions.
          </strong>
          The license granted in
      Section 3, above, is expressly made subject to and limited by
      the following restrictions:
         </p>
         <ol type="a">
          <li>
           You may reproduce, distribute, publicly display,
        publicly perform, communicate the Work, publicly digitally
        perform the Work only under the terms of this License and
        You must include a copy of this License, or the Uniform
        Resource Identifier for this License with every copy or
        phonorecord of the Work You distribute, publicly display,
        publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may
        not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or
        restrict the terms of this License or the recipients'
        exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not
        sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that
        refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties.
        You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform,
        or publicly digitally perform the Work with any
        technological measures that control access or use of the
        Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this
        License Agreement. The above applies to the Work as
        incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not
        require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to
        be made subject to the terms of this License. If You create
        a Collective Work, upon notice from the Licensor, You must,
        to the extent practicable, remove from the Collective Work
        any credit as required by Clause 4(c), as requested.
          </li>
          <li>
           You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You
        in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended
        for or directed toward commercial advantage or private
        monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other
        copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or
        otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or
        directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary
        compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary
        compensation in connection with such an exchange of
        copyrighted works.
          </li>
          <li>
           If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform,
        or publicly digitally perform the Work or Collective Works,
        You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
        provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are
        utilizing, the following:
