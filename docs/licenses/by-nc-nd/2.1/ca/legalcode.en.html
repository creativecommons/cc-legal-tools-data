            "Derivative Work"
           </strong>
           means a work that produces or reproduces the Work or any substantial part thereof in any material form whatever. Derivative works include:
           <ol type="i">
            <li>
             Translations of the Work;
            </li>
            <li>
             Where the Work is a dramatic work, conversions of the Work into a novel or other non-dramatic work;

           2. Fair Dealing Rights.
          </strong>
          Nothing in this licence is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any rights accruing to fair dealing, and those exemptions afforded to educational institutions, libraries, archives, museums, computer programs, incidental inclusions and ephemeral recordings, or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other applicable laws.

           3. Licence Grant.
          </strong>
          Subject to the terms and conditions of this Licence, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) Licence to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
         </p>
         <ol type="a">
          <li>
           to use the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collective Works, and to use the Work as incorporated in the Collective Works;
          </li>
          <li>
           to distribute copies or soundrecordings of, display publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works.
          </li>
         </ol>
         <p>
          The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the rights set forth in Section 4(b) and 4(e).
         </p>
         <p>
          Except as otherwise agreed by the Original Author, the Moral Right of Integrity associated with the Work being licensed is expressly waived. This means the Original Author is not reserving the ability to prevent downstream creators from engaging in material distortion or modification of the work that may be prejudicial to the Original Author's honour or reputation, including associating the Work with a particular product, service, cause or institution.
         </p>
         <p>
          <strong>
           4. Restrictions.
          </strong>
          The licence granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
         </p>
         <ol type="a">
          <li>
           You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this Licence, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this Licence with every copy or soundrecordings of the Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this or the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may not sublicence the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with the terms of this Licence Agreement. The above applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this Licence. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, include or remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, include or remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.
          </li>
          <li>
           You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the exchange of copyrighted works.
          </li>
          <li>
           If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works, You must keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if supplied; the title of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). Such credit may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.
          </li>
          <li>
           Except as otherwise agreed by the Original Author, if You produce, reproduce, distribute, perform, publish, translate, convert, adopt or communicate to the public a Work or any Derivative Works or Collective Works in any material form whatever, You must not do anything that would offend the Moral Right of Attribution of the Original Author, including but not limited to:
           <ol type="i">
            <li>
             You must not falsely attribute the Work to someone other than the Original Author; and
            </li>
            <li>
             If applicable, You must respect the Original Author’s wish to remain anonymous or pseudonymous.
            </li>
           </ol>
          </li>

             Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a performance rights society, royalties for the public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work if that performance is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.

             <strong>
              Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties.
             </strong>
             Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music rights agency, collective society, or designated agent, royalties for any soundrecording You create from the Work ("cover version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory licence created by section 69 (2) of the Canadian Copyright Act), if Your distribution of such cover version is primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.
