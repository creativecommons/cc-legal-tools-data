        and formats. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor waives
        the right to collect royalties (whether individually or, in
        the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting
        society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via
        that society) from any exercise by you of the rights granted
        under this license. All rights not expressly granted by
        Licensor are hereby reserved.

          <strong>
           4. Restrictions.
          </strong>
          The license granted in
        Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by
        the following restrictions:
         </p>
         <ol type="a">
          <li>
           You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only
          under the terms of this License. You must include a copy
          of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this
          License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or
          Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on
          the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the
          ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the
          rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
          License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
          intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
          disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
          Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
          Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any
          effective technological measures on the Work that restrict
          the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to
          exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the
          terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the
          Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not
          require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be
          made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
          Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
          extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit
          as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create
          an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to
          the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any
          credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.
          </li>
          <li>
           If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any
          Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has
          been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all
          copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to
          the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the
          Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,
          and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate
          another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute,
          publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution
          Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service
          or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or
          parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to
          the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that
          Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless
          such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or
          licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent
          with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit
          identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,
          "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or
          "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author").
          The credit required by this Section 4(b) may be
          implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however,
          that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a
          minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all
          contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection
          appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at
          least as prominent as the credits for the other
          contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may
          only use the credit required by this Section for the
          purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by
          exercising Your rights under this License, You may not
          implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection
          with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
          Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of
          You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express
          prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor
          and/or Attribution Parties.

          UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN

        PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE.
        SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
        WARRANTIES, SO THIS EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

           6. Limitation on Liability.
          </strong>
          EXCEPT TO
        THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE  LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
        LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY
        SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY
        DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK,
        EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
        DAMAGES.

           7. Termination
          </strong>
         </p>
         <ol type="a">
          <li>
           This License and the rights granted hereunder will
          terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the
          terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have
          received Adaptations or Collections from You under this
          License, however, will not have their licenses terminated
          provided such individuals or entities remain in full
          compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7,
          and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
          </li>
          <li>
           Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license
          granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the
          applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the
          above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
          under different license terms or to stop distributing the
          Work at any time; provided, however that any such election
          will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
          license that has been, or is required to be, granted under
          the terms of this License), and this License will continue
          in full force and effect unless terminated as stated
          above.

          or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a
          license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as
          the license granted to You under this License.
          </li>
          <li>
           Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an
          Adaptation, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
          the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the
          license granted to You under this License.

          <li>
           If any provision of this License is invalid or
          unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect
          the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
          terms of this License, and without further action by the
          parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
          reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
          provision valid and enforceable.
          </li>
          <li>
           No term or provision of this License shall be deemed
          waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or
          consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be
          charged with such waiver or consent.
