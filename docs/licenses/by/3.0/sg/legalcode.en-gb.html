           "Adaptation"
          </strong>
          means a work based upon
          the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing works,
          such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work,
          arrangement of music or other alterations of a literary or
          artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes
          cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the
          Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted including in
          any form recognizably derived from the original, except
          that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be
          considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
          For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
          work, performance or phonogram, the synchronization of the
          Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching")
          will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this
          License.

          works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of
          the selection and arrangement of their contents,
          constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is
          included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one
          or more other contributions, each constituting separate
          and independent works in themselves, which together are
          assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes
          a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation (as
          defined above) for the purposes of this License.

          3. License Grant.
         </strong>
         Subject to the terms
        and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You a
        worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the
        duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise
        the rights in the Work as stated below:
        </p>
        <ol type="a">
         <li>
          to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into
          one or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as
          incorporated in the Collections;
         </li>
         <li>
          to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any
          such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium,
          takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or
          otherwise identify that changes were made to the original
          Work. For example, a translation could be marked "The
          original work was translated from English to Spanish," or
          a modification could indicate "The original work has been
          modified.";
         </li>
         <li>
          to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including
          as incorporated in Collections; and,
         </li>
         <li>
          to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
         </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
         The above rights may be exercised in all media and
        formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above
        rights include the right to make such modifications as are
        technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media
        and formats. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor waives
        the right to collect royalties (whether individually or, in
        the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting
        society that administers voluntary licensing schemes, via
        that society) from any exercise by you of the rights granted
        under this license. All rights not expressly granted by
        Licensor are hereby reserved.
        </p>
        <p>
         <strong>
          4. Restrictions.
         </strong>
         The license granted in
        Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by
        the following restrictions:
        </p>
        <ol type="a">
         <li>
          You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only
          under the terms of this License. You must include a copy
          of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this
          License with every copy of the Work You Distribute or
          Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on
          the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the
          ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the
          rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
          License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
          intact all notices that refer to this License and to the
          disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
          Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
          Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any
          effective technological measures on the Work that restrict
          the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to
          exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the
          terms of the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the
          Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does not
          require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be
          made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a
          Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the
          extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit
          as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create
          an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to
          the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any
          credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.
         </li>
         <li>
          If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any
          Adaptations or Collections, You must, unless a request has
          been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all
          copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to
          the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the
          Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied,
          and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate
          another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute,
          publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution
          Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service
          or by other reasonable means, the name of such party or
          parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to
          the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that
          Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless
          such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or
          licensing information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent
          with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit
          identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,
          "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or
          "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author").
          The credit required by this Section 4(b) may be
          implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however,
          that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a
          minimum such credit will appear, if a credit for all
          contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection
          appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at
          least as prominent as the credits for the other
          contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may
          only use the credit required by this Section for the
          purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by
          exercising Your rights under this License, You may not
          implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection
          with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
          Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of
          You or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express
          prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor
          and/or Attribution Parties.

         <li>
          This License and the rights granted hereunder will

          terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have
          received Adaptations or Collections from You under this
          License, however, will not have their licenses terminated
          provided such individuals or entities remain in full
          compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7,
          and 8 will survive any termination of this License.

          Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license
          granted here is perpetual (for the duration of the
          applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the
          above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work
          under different license terms or to stop distributing the
          Work at any time; provided, however that any such election
          will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
          license that has been, or is required to be, granted under
          the terms of this License), and this License will continue
          in full force and effect unless terminated as stated

          the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the

          parties to this agreement, such provision shall be

          charged with such waiver or consent.
