           means a work based
          upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing
          works, such as a translation, adaptation, arrangement of
          music or other alterations of a literary or artistic

          its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more

          4. Restrictions.
         </strong>
         The licence granted in
        Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by
        the following restrictions:
        </p>
        <ol type="a">
         <li>
          <p>
           The User may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
          only under the terms of this Licence. The User must
          include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier
          (URI) for, this Licence with every copy of the Work the
          User Distributes or Publicly Performs. The User may not
          offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the
          terms of this Licence or the ability of the recipient of
          the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient
          under the terms of the Licence.
          </p>
          <p>
           The User may not sublicense the Work.
          </p>
          <p>
           The User must keep intact all notices that refer to
            this Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties with
            every copy of the Work Distributed or Publicly
            Performed by the User.
          </p>
          <p>
           When the User Distributes or Publicly Performs the
            Work, they may not impose any effective technological
            measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a
            recipient of the Work from the User to exercise the
            rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
            Licence.
          </p>
          <p>
           This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as
            incorporated in a Collection, but this does not require
            the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made
            subject to the terms of this Licence.
          </p>
          <p>
           If the User creates a Collection, upon notice from
            any Licensor, the User must, to the extent practicable,
            remove from the Collection any credit as required by
            Section 4(d), as requested.
          </p>
          <p>
           If the User creates a Derivative Work, upon notice
            from any Licensor the User must, to the extent
            practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit
            as required by Section 4(d), as requested.

              Applicable Licence or the ability of the recipient of
              the Derivative Work to exercise the rights granted to
              that recipient under the terms of the Applicable

             When the User Distributes or Publicly Performs
              the Derivative Work, the User may not impose any
              effective technological measures on the Derivative
              Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the
              Derivative Work from the User to exercise the rights
              granted to that recipient under the terms of the
              Applicable Licence.

          <p>
           This Section 4(b) applies to the Derivative Work as
            incorporated in a collection, but this does not require
            the collection apart from the Derivative Work
            themselves to be made subject to the terms of the
            Applicable Licence.

           The User may not exercise any of the rights granted
          to them in Section 3 above in any manner that is
          primarily intended for or directed toward commercial
          advantage or private monetary compensation. The exchange
          of the Work for other copyrighted works by means of
          digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered
          to be primarily intended for or directed toward
          commercial advantage or private monetary compensation,
          provided there is no payment of any monetary compensation
          in connection with the exchange of copyrighted
          works.

          <p>
           If the User Distributes, or Publicly Performs the
          Work or any Derivative Work or Collections, they must,
          unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a),
          keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
          provide, reasonable to the medium or means they are
          utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or
          pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the
          Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party
          or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity,
          journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in
          Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other
          reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; (ii)
          the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent
          reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
          specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI
          does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
          information for the Work; and, (iv) consistent with
          Section 3(b), in the case of Derivative Work, a credit
          identifying the use of the Work (e.g., "French
          translation of the Work by Original Author," or
          "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author").
          </p>
          <p>
           The credit required by this Section 4(d) may be
            implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
            however, that in the case of Derivative Work or a
            Collection, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a
            credit for all contributing authors of the Derivative
            Work or Collection appears, then as part of these
            credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the
            credits for the other contributing authors.
          </p>
          <p>
           For the avoidance of doubt, the User may only use
            the credit required by this Section for the purpose of
            attribution in the manner set out above and, by
            exercising rights under this Licence, the User may not
            implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection
            with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original

          Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on
          September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the
          WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and
          Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright
          Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights
          and subject matter take effect in Uganda or relevant
          jurisdiction in which the Licence terms are sought to be
          enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
          implementation of those treaty provisions in the
          applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights

          additional rights not granted under this Licence, such
          additional rights are deemed to be included in the

          license of any rights under the Uganda Copyright and
          Neighbouring Rights Act no.19 of 2006 or any other
