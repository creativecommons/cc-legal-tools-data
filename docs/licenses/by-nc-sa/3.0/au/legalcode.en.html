          <strong>
           "Collection"
          </strong>
          means the Work in its
            entirety in unmodified form along with one or more
            other separate and independent works, assembled into a
            collective whole. A Collection may, for example,
            include a periodical, encyclopedia or anthology. A
            Collection will not be considered a Derivative Work for
            the purposes of this Licence.

         <li>
          <strong>
           "Commercial"
          </strong>
          means primarily
            intended for or directed towards commercial advantage
            or private monetary compensation. The exchange of the
            Work for other copyright works by means of digital
            file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be
            Commercial, provided there is no payment of any
            monetary compensation in connection with the exchange
            of copyright works.

         <li>
          <strong>
           "Derivative Work"
          </strong>
          means material
            in any form that is created by editing, modifying or
            adapting the Work, a substantial part of the Work, or
            the Work and other pre-existing works. Derivative Works
            may, for example, include a translation, adaptation,
            musical arrangement, dramatisation, motion picture
            version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment,
            condensation, or any other form in which the Work may
            be transformed or adapted, except that a Collection
            will not be considered a Derivative Work for the
            purpose of this Licence. For the avoidance of doubt,
            where the Work is a musical composition or sound
            recording, the synchronization of the Work in
            timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be
            considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this
            Licence.

        <p>
         The above rights may be exercised in any media or

         All rights not expressly granted by the Licensor are

          whether individually or via a licensing body such as a
          collecting society, for any Commercial use of the Work.
          The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties for

         <li>
          You must not offer or impose any terms on the Work
            that restrict this Licence or the ability of a
            recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights
            granted to them by this Licence.

         <li>
          You are not granted the right to sublicense the

            Collection, or the Collection apart from the Work
            itself, to be made subject to this Licence.

          You may only Distribute or publicly perform a

          <ol type="i">

                (such as Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0
                Netherlands).
           </li>
          </ol>
          In this clause 4B, whichever of the above licences
              You choose to apply to a Derivative Work is the
              "Applicable Licence".

         <li>
          You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
            Identifier (such as a web link) for, the Applicable
            Licence with every copy of the Derivative Work You
            Distribute or publicly perform.
         </li>
         <li>
          You must not impose any terms on the Derivative

            to exercise the rights granted to them by that

            Derivative Work that You Distribute or publicly
            perform.
         </li>
         <li>
          When You Distribute or publicly perform a
            Derivative Work You must not impose any technological
            measures on it that restrict the ability of a recipient
            of the Derivative Work from You to exercise the rights
            granted to them by the Applicable Licence.

          For the avoidance of doubt, while this clause 4B
            applies to any Derivative Work as incorporated into a

            the Collection, or the Collection as a whole, to be
            made subject to the terms of the Applicable

          In the case of a Derivative Work or Collection, the

         <li>
          You must, to the extent practicable, remove the

          different licence terms or to stop distributing the Work
          at any time. However, any such release will not serve to
          withdraw this Licence (or any other licence that has been
          granted under the terms of this Licence), and this
          Licence will continue in full force and effect unless
          terminated as stated above.

          unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect
          the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
          terms of this Licence. Without further action by the

          breach consented to unless such waiver or consent is in
          writing and signed by the relevant party.

          are no understandings, agreements or representations with
          respect to the Work not specified here. The Licensor
          shall not be bound by any additional provisions that may
          appear in any communication from You. This Licence may
          not be modified without the written agreement of the
