original Work. In the case of a musical Work and/or audio recording, the
mere
synchronization ("synching") of the Work with a moving image shall not be
considered a transformation of the Work into something substantially
different.

Author credit reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by
conveying the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if
supplied;  to the extent reasonably practicable, provide the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any,
that
Licensor specifies to be associated with a Derivative Work, unless such
Uniform Resource Identifier does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for
the Work; and provide a credit identifying the use of the Work in the
Derivative
Work (e.g., "Remix of the Work by Original Author," or "Inclusion of a

be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that at a

credit appears and in a manner at least as prominent as such other

restrict the terms of this License or the recipients' exercise of the
rights granted hereunder.  You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
warranties.  Upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any reference to such
Licensor or the Original Author, as requested.

Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works from You under

any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
withdraw this License (or any other license that has been granted under
the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force
