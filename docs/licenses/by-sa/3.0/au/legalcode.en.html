            the Work, or the Work and other pre-existing works.
            Derivative Works may, for example, include a

            only under the terms of this Licence.

         <li>
          You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource

          You must not offer or impose any terms on the Work

            recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights
            granted to them by this Licence.
         </li>
         <li>
          You are not granted the right to sublicense the
            Work. The rights of recipients of the Work from You are
            governed by clause 9.

          When You Distribute or publicly perform the Work,

          For the avoidance of doubt, while this clause 4A
            applies to the Work as incorporated into a Collection,
            it does not require other material within the
            Collection, or the Collection apart from the Work
            itself, to be made subject to this Licence.

          different licence terms or to stop distributing the Work
          at any time. However, any such release will not serve to
          withdraw this Licence (or any other licence that has been
          granted under the terms of this Licence), and this
          Licence will continue in full force and effect unless
          terminated as stated above.

          unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect
          the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
          terms of this Licence. Without further action by the

          breach consented to unless such waiver or consent is in
          writing and signed by the relevant party.
