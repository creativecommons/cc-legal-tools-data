                  means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other
                  preexisting works. Adaptations include:
                  <ol type="i">

                    <li>

                    <li>
                      Where the Work is a novel or other non-dramatic work or an
                      artistic work: conversions of the Work into a dramatic
                      work by way of performance in public or otherwise;

                    <li>
                      Where the Work is a literary or dramatic or musical work:
                      a sound recording, cinematograph film or other mechanical
                      contrivance by means of which the Work may be mechanically

                  A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be
                  considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this Licence.
                  Where the Work is a musical composition or sound recording,
                  the synchronization of the Work in time-relation with a moving
                  image (i.e. cinematographic work “synching”) will be treated
                  as an Adaptation for the purposes of this Licence.

                  <strong> "Author" </strong>
                  has the same meaning determined by applicable law. For
                  example, the Author is (i) the individuals or entities who
                  created a literary or artistic work or, if no individual or
                  entity can be identified, the publisher; (ii) the individuals
                  who perform a performance; (iii) the producer who first fixes
                  the sounds of a performance in an audio recording; or, (iv)
                  the organization that transmits a broadcast.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong> "Collective Work" </strong>
                  means (i) an encyclopaedia, dictionary, year book or similar
                  work; (ii) a newspaper, review, magazine or similar
                  periodical; and (iii) any work written in distinct parts by
                  different authors, or in which works or parts of works of
                  different authors are incorporated. A work that constitutes a
                  Collective Work will not be considered an Adaptation (as
                  defined above) for the purposes of this Licence.

                Subject to the terms and conditions of this Licence, Licensor
                hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty- free, non-exclusive,
                perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) Licence
                to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:

                </li>
                <li>
                  to create and reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
                  Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes
                  reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise
                  identify that changes were made to the original Work. For
                  example, a translation could be marked, "The original work was
                  translated from English to Spanish", or a modification could
                  indicate, "The original work has been modified";

              <p>
                <strong> 4. Restrictions: </strong>
                The licence granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject
                to and limited by the following restrictions:
              </p>
              <ol type="a">
                <li>
                  You may distribute or publicly perform the Work only under the
                  terms of this Licence. You must include a copy of, or the
                  Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this Licence with every
                  copy of the Work You distribute or publicly perform. You may
                  not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the
                  terms of this Licence or the ability of the recipient of the
                  Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under
                  the terms of the Licence. You may not sublicense the Work. You
                  must keep intact all notices that refer to this Licence and to
                  the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You
                  distribute or publicly perform. When You distribute or
                  publicly perform the Work, You may not impose any
                  technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability
                  of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights
                  granted to that recipient under the terms of the Licence. This
                  Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a
                  Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work
                  apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of
                  this Licence. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice
                  from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove
                  from the Collective Work any credit as required by Section
                  4(c), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice
                  from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove
                  from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as
                  requested.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You may distribute or publicly perform an Adaptation only
                  under: (i) the terms of this Licence; (ii) a later version of
                  this Licence with the same Licence Elements as this Licence;
                  (iii) either the Creative Commons (Unported) licence or a
                  Creative Commons jurisdiction licence (either this or a later
                  version) that contains the same Licence Elements as this
                  Licence (e.g., Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0
                  (Unported)) ("Applicable Licence"); or (iv) a Creative Commons
                  Compatible Licence. If you license the Adaptation under one of
                  the licences mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms
                  of that licence. If you license the Adaptation under the terms
                  any of the licences mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the
                  "Applicable Licence"), you must comply with the terms of the
                  Applicable Licence generally and the following provisions: You
                  must include a copy of or the URI for the Applicable Licence
                  or other licence specified in the previous sentence with every
                  copy of or sound recording of each Adaptation You distribute
                  or publicly perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on
                  the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the Applicable
                  Licence or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation to
                  exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms
                  of the Applicable Licence. You must keep intact all notices
                  that refer to the Applicable Licence and to the disclaimer of
                  warranties with every copy of the Work as included in the
                  Adaptation You distribute or publicly perform. When You
                  distribute or publicly perform the Adaptation, You may not
                  impose any technological measures on the Adaptation that
                  restrict the ability of a recipient of the Adaptation from You
                  to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the
                  terms of the Applicable Licence. This Section 4(b) applies to
                  the Adaptation as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this
                  does not require the Collective Work apart from the Adaptation
                  itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable
                  Licence.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If You distribute, or publicly perform the Work or any
                  Adaptations or Collective Works, You must, unless a request
                  has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all
                  copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the
                  medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the Author
                  (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the
                  Author and/or Licensor designates another party or parties
                  (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
                  attribution (“Attribution Parties”) in Licensor's copyright
                  notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the
                  name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if
                  supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI,
                  if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the
                  Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice
                  or licensing information for the Work; and, (iv) consistent
                  with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit
                  identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g.,
                  “French translation of the Work by Author,” or “Screenplay
                  based on original Work by Author”). The credit required by
                  this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
                  provided, however, that in the case of an Adaptation or
                  Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a
                  credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or
                  Collective Work appears, then as part of these credits and in
                  a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other
                  contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only
                  use the credit required by this Section for the purpose of
                  attribution in the manner set out above and, by exercising
                  Your rights under this Licence, You may not implicitly or
                  explicitly assert or imply any connection with, sponsorship or
                  endorsement by the Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
                  Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work,
                  without the separate, express prior written permission of the
                  Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.

                  Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Author, in those
                  jurisdictions in which the moral right of integrity exists and
                  by operation of local law constrains the freedom to adapt or
                  collect the licensed Work, where Licensor holds moral rights
                  in the Work and where the exercise of the right granted in
                  Section 3(b) of this Licence (the right to make Adaptations)
                  could violate the moral right of integrity, Licensor agrees to
                  waive or not assert, as appropriate, the moral right of
                  integrity, to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable
                  national law, as long as You do not distort, mutilate, modify
                  or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work that
                  would be prejudicial to the Author’s honour or reputation, so
                  as to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right under
                  Section 3(b) of this Licence but not otherwise.

                OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE

                BREACH OF THE WARRANTIES IN SECTION 5, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR

                  or Collective Works from You under this Licence, however, will
                  not have their licences terminated provided such individuals

                  Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of

                  reserves the right to release the Work under different licence
                  terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time; provided,
                  however that any such election will not serve to withdraw this
                  Licence (or any other licence that has been, or is required to
                  be, granted under the terms of this Licence), and this Licence

                  Creative Commons is not a party to this Licence, and makes no
                  warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative
                  Commons will not be liable to You or any party on any legal
                  theory for any damages whatsoever, including without
                  limitation any general, special, incidental or consequential
                  damages arising in connection to this licence. Notwithstanding
                  the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative Commons has
                  expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it
                  shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.

                <p>
                  Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public
                  that the Work is licensed under this Licence, Creative Commons
                  does not authorize the use by either party of the trade-mark
                  "Creative Commons" or any related trade-mark or logo of
                  Creative Commons without the prior written consent of Creative
                  Commons. Any permitted use will be in compliance with Creative
                  Commons' then-current trade-mark usage guidelines, as may be
                  published on its website or otherwise made available upon
                  request from time to time. For the avoidance of doubt, this
                  trade-mark restriction does not form part of the Licence.
