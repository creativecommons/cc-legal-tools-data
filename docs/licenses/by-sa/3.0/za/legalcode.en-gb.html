              4.3.2.1. the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym if provided) if supplied, and/or any other party ("Attribution Parties") that the Original Author or Licensor has, e.g. in the copyright notice or terms of use, requested to be attributed (such as a sponsor institute, publishing Entity or journal);

          7.1. This Licence and the rights granted to You under this Licence shall terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this Licence.

         <li>
          7.3. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the Licence granted here is for the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work. Notwithstanding this, the Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under different licence terms or to stop distributing the Work at any time. However, any such election will not serve to withdraw this Licence (or any other Licence that has been granted under the terms of this Licence), and this Licence will continue in full force and effect unless terminated as stated above.

          9.1. If any provision of this Licence is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this Licence, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
         </li>
         <li>
          9.2. No term or provision of this Licence shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.

         <li>
          9.3. This Licence constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the Work licensed here.
