           "Collective Work"
          </strong>
          means a work, such
          as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia, in
          which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along
          with one or more other contributions, constituting
          separate and independent works in themselves, are
          assembled into a collective whole. A work that
          constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a
          Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of
          this License.

          <strong>
           "Derivative Work"
          </strong>
          means a work based
          upon the Work or upon the Work and other pre-existing
          works, such as a translation, musical arrangement,
          dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version,
          sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment,
          condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be
          recast, transformed, or adapted, except that a work that
          constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a
          Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the
          avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
          composition or sound recording, the synchronization of
          the Work in timed-relation with a moving image
          ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the
          purpose of this License.

         Subject to the terms
        and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants You
        a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for
        the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
        exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
        </p>
        <ol type="a">
         <li>
          to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into
          one or more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work
          as incorporated in the Collective Works;
         </li>
         <li>
          to create and reproduce Derivative Works provided
          that any such Derivative Work, including any translation
          in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label,
          demarcate or otherwise identify that changes were made to
          the original Work. For example, a translation could be
          marked "The original work was translated from English to
          Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original
          work has been modified.";
         </li>
         <li>
          to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display
          publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means
          of a digital audio transmission the Work including as
          incorporated in Collective Works;
         </li>
         <li>
          to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display
          publicly, perform publicly, and perform publicly by means
          of a digital audio transmission Derivative Works;
         </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
         The above rights may be exercised in all media and
        formats whether now known or hereafter devised. The above
        rights include the right to make such modifications as are
        technically necessary to exercise the rights in other media
        and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor
        are hereby reserved, including but not limited to the
        rights set forth in Sections 4(d) and 4(e).

        <p>
         <strong>
          4. Restrictions.
         </strong>
         The license granted in
        Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and limited by
        the following restrictions:
        </p>
        <ol type="a">
         <li>
          You may distribute, publicly display, publicly
          perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work only
          under the terms of this License, and You must include a
          copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, this
          License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You
          distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
          publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose
          any terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this
          License or the ability of a recipient of the Work to
          exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the
          terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work.
          You must keep intact all notices that refer to this
          License and to the disclaimer of warranties. When You
          distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
          publicly digitally perform the Work, You may not impose
          any technological measures on the Work that restrict the
          ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise
          the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
          the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as
          incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not
          require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to
          be made subject to the terms of this License. If You
          create a Collective Work, upon notice from any Licensor
          You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
          Collective Work any credit as required by Section 4(c),
          as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon
          notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
          practicable, remove from the Derivative Work any credit
          as required by Section 4(c), as requested.
         </li>
         <li>
          You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You
          in Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily
          intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
          private monetary compensation. The exchange of the Work
          for other copyrighted works by means of digital
          file-sharing or otherwise shall not be considered to be
          intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or
          private monetary compensation, provided there is no
          payment of any monetary compensation in connection with
          the exchange of copyrighted works.
         </li>
         <li>
          If You distribute, publicly display, publicly
          perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work (as
          defined in Section 1 above) or any Derivative Works (as
          defined in Section 1 above) or Collective Works (as
          defined in Section 1 above), You must, unless a request
          has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all
          copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to
          the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of
          the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if
          supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or
          Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a
          sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
          attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's
          copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
          means, the name of such party or parties; the title of
          the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably
          practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any,
          that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work,
          unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or
          licensing information for the Work; and, consistent with
          Section 3(b) in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit
          identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work
          (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original
          Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by
          Original Author"). The credit required by this Section
          4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
          provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work
          or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear,
          if a credit for all contributing authors of the
          Derivative Work or Collective Work appears, then as part
          of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as
          the credits for the other contributing authors. For the
          avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required
          by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
          manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under
          this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert
          or imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement
          by the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
          Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work,
          without the separate, express prior written permission of
          the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
          Parties.

         <li>
          This License and the rights granted hereunder will
          terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the
          terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have
          received Derivative Works (as defined in Section 1 above)
          or Collective Works (as defined in Section 1 above) from
          You under this License, however, will not have their
          licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities
          remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections
          1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this
          License.
         </li>
         <li>
          Subject to the above terms and conditions, the
          license granted here is perpetual (for the duration of
          the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
          the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the
          Work under different license terms or to stop
          distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that
          any such election will not serve to withdraw this License
          (or any other license that has been, or is required to
          be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
          License will continue in full force and effect unless
          terminated as stated above.

         <li>
          Each time You distribute or publicly digitally
          perform the Work (as defined in Section 1 above) or a
          Collective Work (as defined in Section 1 above), the
          Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the Work on
          the same terms and conditions as the license granted to
          You under this License.
         </li>
         <li>
          Each time You distribute or publicly digitally
          perform a Derivative Work, Licensor offers to the
          recipient a license to the original Work on the same
          terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
          this License.
         </li>
         <li>
          If any provision of this License is invalid or
          unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect
          the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
          terms of this License, and without further action by the
          parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
          reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such
          provision valid and enforceable.
         </li>
         <li>
          No term or provision of this License shall be deemed
          waived and no breach consented to unless such waiver or
          consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be
          charged with such waiver or consent.

         <li>
          This License constitutes the entire agreement between
          the parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There
          are no understandings, agreements or representations with
          respect to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall
          not be bound by any additional provisions that may appear
          in any communication from You. This License may not be
          modified without the mutual written agreement of the
          Licensor and You.
