          <li>
           <strong>
            "Collection"
           </strong>
           means the Work in its
            entirety in unmodified form along with one or more
            other separate and independent works, assembled into a
            collective whole. A Collection may, for example,
            include a periodical, encyclopedia or anthology. A
            Collection will not be considered a Derivative Work for
            the purposes of this Licence.

          <li>
           <strong>
            "Derivative Work"
           </strong>
           means material in any form that is created by editing,
            modifying or adapting the Work, a substantial part of
            the Work, or the Work and other pre-existing works.
            Derivative Works may, for example, include a
            translation, adaptation, musical arrangement,
            dramatisation, motion picture version, sound recording,
            art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any
            other form in which the Work may be transformed or
            adapted, except that a Collection will not be
            considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this
            Licence. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is
            a musical composition or sound recording, the
            synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a
            moving image ("synching") will be considered a
            Derivative Work for the purpose of this Licence.

          Moral rights remain unaffected to the extent they are

          "moral rights" means the personal rights granted by law
          to the Original Author of a copyright work. For example,
          Part IX of the
          <em>
           Copyright Act 1968
          </em>
          (Cth) grants
          authors the right of integrity of authorship, the right
          of attribution of authorship, and the right not to have
          authorship falsely attributed.

          unenforceable under applicable law, it shall not affect
          the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the
          terms of this Licence. Without further action by the

           11. Waivers and Consents
